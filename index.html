    <p style="text-align: justify;"><i>View From Above</i> is a contemporary photographic exploration of the West Side Highway, observed through a pedestrian lens that intertwines themes of sex, property, historical erasure, public transgression, opulence, and urban development.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">A native New Yorker raised in Greenwich Village, I am often unnerved by the dissonance between the Village of the present, the Village of my upbringing, and the Village of the past. The title, <i>View From Above</i>, alludes to the shift from a street-level perspective of the highway to the contemporary gaze from the new high-rise apartment complexes.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The photobook delves into my personal experiences as a young trans individual navigating the Highwayâ€™s sexual landscapes that shaped my adolescence. Through architectural images of public cruising grounds contrasted with intimate photos taken in the opulent apartments and hotels that have been sprouting up along the highway, the project unveils intersections of personal history, urban experiences, and sex in a capitalist society.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In this exploration, I confront these commercial forces seeking to purge the West Side of its queer histories, while reckoning with the ways I myself am complicit in this erasure. Utilizing the iPhone, spy cameras, and appropriated imagery, I seek to craft a new, contemplative vision of the West Side Highway, where I am both witness and participant in its metamorphosis.</p>
